# WatchyWatch
A user-friendly WordPress website for streaming movies and TV series.
The website offers users a user-friendly interface with login, category filtering, and easy content search. The site integrates an IFRAME module, enabling seamless viewing of cloud-based video content directly on the site. Regular updates keep the content fresh, and the customized interface helps users quickly find what they want.
